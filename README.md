## Features

- Run any build target defined in Your project's FAKE build script

## Configuration

`ionide-fake` allows the user to override the default conventions used to find and run FAKE builds. To do so You need to create an `.ionide` file in the root folder of Your project opened by Atom. The configuration file uses the [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) language.

Here is the default configuration values used if the `.ionide` file doesn't exist or some entry is missing:

```TOML
[Fake]
linuxPrefix = "mono"
command = "build.cmd"
build = "build.fsx"
```

* Linux Prefix - command used as prefix on Linux / Mac - usually `sh` or `mono`

* Command - command executed as build taking build name as parameter - usually `build.cmd`, `build.sh`, `build.ps1`

* Build - FAKE build script, which is parsed to obtain list of possible builds - usually `build.fsx`, `fake.fsx`

### Command Key Bindings

When creating Command Palette key bindings for FAKE the command names are:

* fake.fakeBuild
* fake.buildDefault (default binding is ctrl+f5)
* fake.cancelBuild

For example, to launch the target list using shift+f5 add the following to the VS Code keybindings.json file:

```json
[
    { "key": "shift+f5", "command": "fake.fakeBuild" }
]
```

## PATH settings

* In case of using Mono version, `mono` must be in PATH.
